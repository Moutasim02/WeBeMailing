# WeBeMailing - Ai Email Generator
Bad email writing is a huge time consumer for everyone. Employees spend hours on end communicating with colleagues
and customers when they could be spending that time doing productive work. But besides being an inconvenience for
everyone involved, bad email writing is also destroying your productivity or even your company’s productivity. The
effects of these poorly written messages are far-reaching. They don’t only slow down the recipient, but they waste hours
of the sender’s day too. Bad email writing takes a lot of time, and it wastes many hours that could have been spent
working productively. That means more time will be wasted when it comes to deadlines and company projects need to be
completed on time, especially during busy seasons.

By giving the email title as an input it will generate one to four suggestions of generated templates so the users can copy
or edit from the website itself, and provide options to generate according to the user tone of preference (appreciative,
Casual, Neutral, Joyful, Formal, Informal, Informative, urgent, etc.), the use case preference (Business idea pitch, regular
Email, caption ideas, etc…) By this, we can use full stack development as students and learn how to integrate all the
components.

This is a partial implementation and is meant for education purposes only.
